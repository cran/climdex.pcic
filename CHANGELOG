0.7-4:
 - Fixed a bug where tavg.dates was being incorrectly checked.

0.7-3:
 - Improve performance of creating climdexInput structure and GSL in the southern hemisphere.

0.7-2:
 - Clean up line length problems with documentation.

0.7-1:
 - Implement much faster bootstrapping algorithm.

0.6-2:
 - Update documentation to reflect all changes.
 - Update and clean up comments.
 - Update climdexInput.csv to accept climdexInput.raw's new arguments.
 - Change order of arguments to climdexInput.raw to match historical order.

0.6-1: MAJOR BUG FIXES, in order of importance (changes results):
 - Changed mistaken code which resulted in quantile type for tn/tx 10/90p being type=6 not type=8. In aggregate, this caused a slight negative bias; individual results may, under some circumstances, vary by very large amounts.
 - Changed quantile method for precipitation (r99ptot, r95ptot) from type=7 to type=8. This caused a small positive bias in aggregate, with large differences under some circumstances.
 - Truncate dates so that last day of data isn't omitted under some conditions. This can cause differences when data is centered on the middle of the day in the final year or month of data, and can cause the last value to be NA.
 - Modified GSL code to not report a GSL 1 day longer than it should have under many circumstances.
 - Modified GSL code to always use July 1st (if NH) or January 1st (if SH); may affect results under certain circumstances with Gregorian calendars.
Minor bug fixes:
 - Mask data with NA for CDD/CWD where the entire year is wet/dry.
Feature enhancements:
 - Exposed interface to quantile method used in C++ code.
 - Added multiple options to allow for compatibility with fclimdex.

0.5-2:
 - Export a few more functions

0.5-1: Feature additions:
 - Add option to produce output for rx5day that matches fclimdex
 - Add output of annual variables for TXx, TNx, TXn, TNn, TN/TX 10/90p, DTR, Rx1day, Rx5day.

0.4-1: MAJOR BUG FIXES (changes results): 
 - r99ptot and r95ptot were using incorrect quantiles (all data, not just the base period). AFFECTS ALL PREVIOUS VERSIONS.
 - Growing season length in Southern Hemisphere was off by 1 year. Does not affect publicly released versions.
Minor bug fix:
 - Fix bug which caused extra year to be included in data when data starts at base period start.

0.3.1-1: Fix introduced issue which broke calculation of GSL for Gregorian calendars; in process, fixed GSL to use July 1st as center.

0.3-2: Fix bug when days are centered at 12:00 (change round to floor)

0.3-1: Add support for GSL in southern hemisphere.

0.2-1: Add more input validation, clean up documentation, add example data, improve performance. No change in results.

0.1-3: Code changes to fix compilation on Solaris. No change in results.

0.1-2: Initial version
